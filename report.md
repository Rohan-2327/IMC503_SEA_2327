# IMC503 SEA – Data Insights Report

## Dataset Used
The dataset contains country-wise COVID-19 statistics, including:
- Confirmed cases  
- Total deaths  
- Recovered cases  
- Active cases  
- WHO region classification  
- Weekly changes  

This report summarises insights from three main visualisations.

---

## 1. Histogram of Confirmed Cases

### **Observation**
The histogram shows that:
- Most countries have **lower to moderate confirmed cases**.
- Only a few countries have extremely **high numbers of confirmed cases**, creating a **right-skewed distribution**.
- This means global cases are concentrated in a small number of heavily affected countries.

### **Insight**
The spread of COVID-19 was **uneven across countries**, with a minority of countries accounting for a majority of global confirmed cases.

## 2. Barplot of WHO Regions

### **Observation**
The barplot shows the count of countries belonging to each WHO Region:
- Regions like **Africa** and **Europe** have the highest number of countries.
- Regions such as **Eastern Mediterranean** and **Americas** have fewer countries represented.

### **Insight**
This helps understand the **regional structure** of the dataset.  
It also explains why some regions have higher totals — not always because of severity but because they have **more countries contributing data**.

## 3. Scatter Plot – Confirmed Cases vs Deaths

### **Observation**
- There is a clear **positive relationship** between confirmed infections and deaths.
- Countries with very high confirmed cases also have more deaths.
- However, some countries with high case counts show relatively lower death counts.

### **Insight**
This indicates:
- Higher case numbers naturally increase fatality numbers.
- Differences in death rates may be due to:
  - healthcare quality  
  - testing/reporting differences  
  - population age structure  
  - vaccination & interventions  

---

## **Overall Conclusion**
The dataset highlights major variations in COVID-19 impact across countries.  
Visualisations reveal:
- **Uneven distribution** of confirmed cases  
- **Clear regional differences**
- **Strong relationship** between confirmed cases and deaths  

These insights help us understand the global pattern of COVID-19 spread and severity.
